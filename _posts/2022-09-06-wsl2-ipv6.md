title: "IPv6 Connectivity in WSL2"
---

I am a big fan of WSL.
One of my biggest complaints about WSL2 (mainly on principle) is that it does not support IPv6.
But with a bit of tweaking, we can make it work.

# Approach 1: WireGuard
We will use an IPv6 tunnelbroker.
WireGuard makes this easy.

1. **Check the kernel.**
In WSL, run `uname -srm` to check the kernel version.
Kernels [since 5.6](https://duo.com/decipher/wireguard-vpn-added-to-linux-kernel) include WireGuard.
If you have an older kernel, see how to replace the kernel below.

2. **Install WireGuard.**
Run `sudo apt install wireguard`.

3. **Create a tunnel.**
Create an account at [route48.org](https://route48.org/).
Create a new IPv6 tunnel.
Set the tunnel type to WireGuard and pick a server location near you.
Click the config icon and copy the configuration into `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`.
Run `sudo wg-quick up wg0` to start the tunnel.

4. **Connect.**
Test your connection with `ping6 google.com`.
It should work now.

5. **Start automatically.**
Edit `/etc/wsl.conf` to contain
```
[boot]
command="wg-quick up wg0"
```
This will start the tunnel every time the WSL instance starts.
The [`[boot]`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#boot-settings) option is new in Windows 11.

# Approach 2: Tailscale
Tailscale is magic.
We can share another device's IPv6 connection with Tailscale.

1. **Create an exit node.**
[Install Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/installation/) on a device with an IPv6 connection.
This might even be your Windows machine.
Configure it as an [exit node](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes/).
Save its Tailscale IP address (`100.x.y.z`) for later.

2. **Start Tailscale automatically.**
[Install Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1031/install-linux/) in WSL.
Edit `/etc/wsl.conf` to contain
```
[boot]
command="PATH=$PATH tailscaled"
```
This will start `tailscaled` every time the WSL instance starts.

3. **Update the kernel.**
Tailscale [needs](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/3420) `CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES`, so we have to build the kernel.
(If you trust me, you can [download my kernel](https://github.com/linusbrogan/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/releases).)
Clone the [WSL2 kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel).
Add a line `CONFIG_IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES=y` to `Microsoft/config-wsl`, and edit the `CONFIG_LOCALVERSION` line with a name you will recognize later.
Follow the build instructions in the [README](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel#readme).
Download/copy `vmlinux` to `C:\vmlinux`.
Create a file [`%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#wslconfig) containing
```
[wsl2]
kernel=C:\\vmlinux
```
(Note the double backslashes in the path.)

4. **Restart WSL**.
Run `wsl.exe --shutdown`.
Check that no WSL2 distros are running with `wsl.exe -l -v`.
Then restart WSL and run `uname -srm` to check that the new kernel is running.
It should have the version string you set in the config file.

5. **Route traffic through the exit node.**
Check that `tailscaled` is running with `ps aux`.
Run `sudo tailscale up --exit-node=100.x.y.z --exit-node-allow-lan-access`, replacing `100.x.y.z` with the exit node's IP address from above.

6. **Connect.**
Test your connection with `ping6 google.com`.
It should work now.
